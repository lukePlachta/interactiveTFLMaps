					<p><strong>Hello</strong>, thank you for viewing my maps of the rail services operating in the UK today. These pages 
					have been coded using mark up languages of HTML and CSS. Eventually I do hope to have this page linked to pages of 
					other national rail lines that will have been made in the same way. This site will be relaunched each time I have fully
					created a new map and a proper opening page and main menu pages will also be implemented in due course. On each map page, 
					you will be able to access the page of another route by selecting that route's name at any interchange station it shares 
					with the line you are currently viewing. Please let me know what you think and do not hesitate to contact me if you have 
					any thoughts or suggestions.</p>
